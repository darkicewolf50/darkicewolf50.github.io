				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					I'm a third year Software Engineer Student at University of Calgary. I
					am learning the language of how to design, develop, and create
					programs that are to industry standards and reasonably efficent. I
					bring the lessons learned from each project I have completed, learning
					from the mistakes I have made and bringing corrected versions forward
					into the next project.
				</p>
				<p>
					As of writing this I intend to bring the knowledge learned from my
					time at university in Software Engineering onto a Baja SAE car, where
					we can collect data remotely and graph data for instantaneous and
					future analysis, during vechile operation.
				</p>
				<p>
					I grew up in a small ski town where, I started learning about
					programming, from of course Minecraft, where I thought the application
					of this was so futuristic and downright cool that I knew I wanted to
					persure it further. While living there I spend a majority of my time
					outside of school swimming competitively, where I ranked top 10 in BC.
					Along with swimming I spend a lot of time volunteering with
					fundraising events and coaching the local Special Olympics swim team.
