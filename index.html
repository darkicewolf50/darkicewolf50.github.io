                                <p>I'm an learning Software Engineer Student, who is trying to learn the language of how to desgin, develop, and create programs that are to industry sandard and reasonably efficent. I hope to bring the lessions learned from each project I have completed, learning from the mistakes I have made and bringing thm forard into the net project.</p>
                                <p>As of writing this I hope to bring the knowldge learned from my time at school in Software Engineering onto a Baja SAE car, where we can collect data remotely and graph live data as it come in while we are driving it, as well as salving it for later for future analysis.</p>
                                <p>I grew up in a small ski town where, I started learning about programming, from of course Minecraft, where I thought the application of this was so futuristic and downright cool that I knew I anted to persure it further. While living there I spend a majority of my time out of school swimming, where I got so good that I was considered top 10 in BC, along with swimming I spend a lot of time volunteering with fundraising events and coaching the disabled.</p>
