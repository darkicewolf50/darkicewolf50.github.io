                                <h1>About</h1>
                                <p>I'm a Software Engineer Student, who is learning the language of how to design, develop, and create programs that are to industry standard and reasonably efficent. I bring the lessons learned from each project I have completed, learning from the mistakes I have made and bringing corrected versions forward into the next project.</p>
                                <p>As of writing this I intend to bring the knowledge learned from my time at school in Software Engineering onto a Baja SAE car, where we can collect data remotely and graph real time data as it comes in while we are driving it, as well as saving it for later for future analysis.</p>
                                <p>I grew up in a small ski town where, I started learning about programming, from of course Minecraft, where I thought the application of this was so futuristic and downright cool that I knew I wanted to persure it further. While living there I spend a majority of my time out of school competitive swimming, where I got so good that I was top 10 in BC, along with swimming I spend a lot of time volunteering with fundraising events and coaching the Special Olympics team.</p>
